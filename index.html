          <h2>Missile Man of Pakistan</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Abdul Qadeer Khan</b> (April 27, 1936 â€“ October 10, 2021) was a
            Pakistani nuclear scientist recognized for his notable contributions
            to Pakistan's nuclear program. Born in Bhopal, British India (now in
            Madhya Pradesh, India), Khan moved to Pakistan after the 1947
            partition. He studied metallurgical engineering in West Germany and
            later specialized in nuclear engineering in the Netherlands. Playing
            a pivotal role in Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, Abdul Qadeer
            Khan was instrumental in the successful nuclear tests in 1998,
            marking Pakistan's entry into the nuclear weapons community. Often
            referred to as the "Father of the Pakistani Nuclear Program," he
            significantly advanced the country's nuclear capabilities. Abdul
            Qadeer Khan's career involved various scientific and administrative
            roles, including his tenure at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission
            (PAEC). His expertise and leadership were crucial in shaping
            Pakistan's nuclear strategy and capabilities.
